# TEACH-X_frontend_demo

A demo of the Teach X app front end

This is my attempt to help with something beyond wire frames.
A clickable demo of some of the pages the teach x website would have.

Wanted a website for teachers that they can post relevant content and lesson plans for other teachers to see, share, discuss, and use.

Create this in react and then react Native to make it a website and app for phones.

After enough posts are in existance machine learning to help predict and suggest to teachers based on who/what they have liked and their unique style.

Kinda like reddit or Instagram. It would be a place teachers can share resources (link articles, videos, post handouts, word-finds, vocab sheets) based on the cirriculum requirements. They would be able to search by subject, grade level, type of materials, (videos, hand-outs, articles) save their favorites, vote as a group community which is great which is relevant, or that which is terrible. Power to the peopl. Knowledge for all.
